# Elections

This project is written in C++ using OOP methodologies during our semester studies in OOP course.

The purpose of this project is to build a system to conduct an elections round.
Managing all the details of parties, districts, citizens, voting system and calculation of results.

In addition we implemented a template class for a one-way linked list with an iterator.
